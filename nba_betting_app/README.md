# NBA Betting Predictor

This simple command line app loads past NBA game results from a CSV file and
computes a basic rating for each team based on average point differential.
Predictions for upcoming games are generated using these ratings and a logistic
function to produce a win probability for the home team.

## Data

Sample data for the 2024 season is provided in `data/sample_games.csv`. The CSV
includes several days of matchups and may contain multiple games on the same
date. It should contain the
=======
Sample data is provided in `data/sample_games.csv`. The CSV should contain the

following columns:

```
date,home_team,away_team,home_points,away_points
```


Additional games can be added to improve the model. The repository includes
several matchups featuring current NBA teams along with sample player game logs
in `data/sample_player_stats.csv`.

### Updating game data

The script `update_data.py` downloads games and basic player box scores from the
[balldontlie](https://www.balldontlie.io) API. New rows are appended to
`data/nba_games.csv` and `data/player_stats.csv` while avoiding duplicates. The
script shows progress with `tqdm` and is configured to run every day at 4:00 AM
if you leave it running:

```
python update_data.py
```

This requires an internet connection and may take a few minutes on the first
run because it fetches the entire current season.

### Refreshing sample data

If you only want a small dataset for demonstration, run `update_games.py`.
It downloads the ten latest games from the 2023 season using the
[balldontlie](https://www.balldontlie.io) API and writes them to
`data/sample_games.csv` and the accompanying player stats to
`data/sample_player_stats.csv`.

## Usage



This will output the predicted probability that the home team (first argument)
beats the away team (second argument) based on the historical data.

The model is intentionally simple and meant only as an example. For real sports
betting use, more sophisticated statistics and much larger datasets would be
required.


## Interactive App

An additional script, `app.py`, offers a small interactive menu where you can
choose teams or players and display the corresponding predictions. Run it with:

```
python app.py
```

You will then be prompted to select whether you want to predict a game outcome
or a player's stats. The data comes from the same sample CSV files mentioned
above and can be extended with more recent games.


## Player Stats Usage

A second script, `player_predictor.py`, demonstrates a very naive approach to predicting individual player statistics. It loads a CSV of past player game logs and outputs the player's average points, rebounds, assists, steals and shooting percentages.


```

The prediction simply mirrors the player's historical averages in the sample data and is **not** meant for real betting use.


## Graphical App

For a simple graphical interface that works in Visual Studio Code, run `gui_app.py`:

```
python gui_app.py
```

This Tkinter-based window lets you choose teams or a player from dropdown menus
and view either a game win probability or the player's average stats.


## Streamlit Web App

If you prefer a web style interface, launch the Streamlit app:

```
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

The page lets you pick the home and away team from dropdown menus and tap the
"ðŸ”® Predict" button. The result appears in a centered card with emoji styling so
it looks great even on mobile screens inside Visual Studio Code. The app no
longer trains a model at startup, so it loads almost instantly.
